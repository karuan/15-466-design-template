<h1>Pacman Herder</h1>

<p>Pacman and extreme herder (neopets) mashup, using the pacman game setting with the added difficulty of having to round up creatures into the central pen.</p>

<p>The ghosts in pacman do not interact with the creatures that pacman has to save (they simply pass through each other, or the ghosts pass thtough the creature really). The creature and the ghosts move at different speeds (to ensure the ghosts don't always fly directly on top of a creature), with the ghosts (generally) moving faster than the creatures.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The game starts the same way as pacman, with an additional n (increases with difficulty, maybe start with 5) number of creatures randomly spawned across the board. The central pen holding the ghosts has openings in all 4 cardinal directions, and the ghosts exit the same way as in pacman, using the north opening. The pacman character moves using the same arrow key controls, with an additional space bar key used to "pick up" a creature, when it is in pacman's vicinity. It can be used to swap out the character that the pacman is currently holding. The pacman needs to go to one of the four openings in the central pen to feed the creature into it. After a set amount of time of being inside the pen, the creature will escape out again. The level ends when all dots are eaten, and all creatures are in the central pen.</p>
<p><b>Levels get harder:</b> more creatures are spawned, and since creatures can escape once being round up, this makes it more challenging. </p>

<p><b>Variety:</b> power-ups, unique creature movements </p>
